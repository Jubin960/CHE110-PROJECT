            <h2>Welcome to Food Waste and Its Reduction</h2>
            <p>Food waste is a global issue that affects the environment, economy, and food security. Every year, approximately one-third of all food produced is wasted, which could feed millions of people. This website aims to provide insights into food waste, its causes, effects, and ways to reduce it.</p>

            <h2>Why Food Waste Matters</h2>
            <p>Food waste has serious environmental impacts. When food is discarded, the resources used to produce it—including water, land, and energy—are also wasted. Decomposing food in landfills emits methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Additionally, the financial cost of food waste is immense, with billions of dollars lost globally every year.</p>
            <p>Reducing food waste is essential to sustainable development. By cutting down on waste, we can conserve resources, reduce emissions, and improve food availability for people in need. Through awareness and adherence to food waste reduction standards, we can all play a role in making a positive impact.</p>
            <p>Explore this website to learn more about the causes of food waste, the standards for reduction, and practical steps you can take to minimize waste in your own life.</p>
