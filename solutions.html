        <h2>Solutions to Reduce Food Waste</h2>
        <p>Food waste is a complex, multi-level problem that requires efforts from individuals, communities, businesses, and governments to solve. Below are strategies and solutions that address food waste reduction at each level, aiming to create a sustainable and food-secure future.</p>

            <h3>Personal Actions</h3>
            <p>Individuals play a crucial role in reducing food waste by adopting simple, sustainable habits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meal Planning:</strong> Plan meals in advance to avoid over-purchasing and impulse buying. This helps prevent excess food that may end up as waste.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Food Storage:</strong> Learn to store food correctly to extend its shelf life. For example, keep fruits and vegetables in appropriate storage areas and understand best-before dates.</li>
                <li><strong>Creative Leftovers:</strong> Use leftovers creatively in new recipes to reduce waste. For instance, vegetable scraps can be used to make soups or stocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Composting:</strong> Composting food scraps that are not suitable for consumption helps reduce landfill waste and produces natural fertilizer for gardening.</li>

                <li><strong>Improved Packaging:</strong> Using sustainable and appropriate packaging can increase the shelf life of products, helping reduce spoilage during transportation and storage.</li>
                <li><strong>Employee Training:</strong> Training employees to manage food responsibly, reduce waste, and optimize processes can significantly reduce waste in food service and retail environments.</li>
