        <h2>Standards and Guidelines for Reducing Food Waste</h2>
        <p>There are established standards and best practices designed to help reduce food waste at every level of the food supply chain. Here’s an overview of key standards and how they promote more efficient food management.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>International Standards</h3>
            <p>Several international organizations have developed standards to minimize food waste and promote sustainability:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ISO 22000:</strong> This standard focuses on food safety management systems, helping organizations reduce food loss due to contamination and mishandling.</li>
                <li><strong>ISO 14001:</strong> An environmental management standard, ISO 14001 helps organizations track and reduce waste, including food waste, as part of their environmental impact management.</li>
                <li><strong>FAO Guidelines:</strong> The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations provides guidelines to support sustainable practices that reduce food waste.</li>

            <h3>National Standards</h3>
            <p>Many countries have introduced their own guidelines and programs to tackle food waste. Some examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>USDA Guidelines:</strong> In the United States, the USDA has set goals and strategies to reduce food waste by 50% by 2030.</li>

            <h3>Corporate Standards</h3>
            <p>Many corporations have adopted internal standards to reduce food waste within their operations, often aligning with international and national guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Food Donation Policies:</strong> Many companies have policies in place to donate surplus food rather than discarding it.</li>
                <li><strong>Inventory Management Standards:</strong> Corporations use advanced inventory tracking to minimize overproduction and waste.</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainability Goals:</strong> Some companies have set ambitious waste reduction targets as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs.</li>
